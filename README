StickyNotes is a simple php application that allows users to share virtual sticky notes.

This system uses a hash comparison to ensure that users don't overwrite each others saves. If the hases don't match, it outputs the diff.

Be sure to lock this off with an .htaccess password.

Features:
	Colored Sticky Notes
	Automatic Category Coloring
	Not Sticky Feature

Examples:
	Straightforward 	— Hello world.
	Category 		— Welcome:Hellow World.
	Ignore (Not Sticky)	— !Hellow World.
Technical Format:
	[!][<Category>:]<Text>
